# Praat Scripts
Here are some of the Praat scripts from my own collection. I will be updating this repository as soon as I have something new to add.

## Opening and Saving Files
[open_all](open_all.praat): its main purpose is to open all objects in Objects' window.

[save_raw](save_raw.praat): saves all sound files in object's window as raw 16-bit little-endian files.

[save_all](save_all.praat): saves all objects in the object window.
