# Praat Scripts
Here are some of the Praat scripts from my own collection. I will be updating this repository as soon as I have something new to add.

## Opening and Saving Files
[open_all](./code/open_all.praat): its main purpose is to open all objects in Objects' window.

[save_raw](./code/save_raw.praat): saves all sound files in object's window as raw 16-bit little-endian files.

[save_all](./code/save_all.praat): saves all objects in the object window.

## View and Edit Files
[view_edit_all](./code/view_edit_all.praat): This script opens all wav files in the Praat Objects' window. If you want to open the files with their associated TextGrid, I have found [this script](./code/check2.praat) created by [Pauline Welby](http://aune.lpl.univ-aix.fr/~welby/PAGES/praat-fr.html) extremely useful.
